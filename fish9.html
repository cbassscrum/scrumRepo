			Largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted bass are the most popular game fish in North America.<br><br>It is also very popular in South Africa where the largemouth bass is often found in lakes, rivers, creeks, and dams.<br><br>When fishing, lures (Bass worms) or live bait will work. Lures that mimic baitfish, worms, crayfish, frogs, and mice are all effective.
